      <h2>Earths Hero</h2>
      <h4>Earth's Hero (or, Goku), is the first and default character of Z Battlegrounds. Earth's Hero provides an easier moveset as well as easier combos, making this character a suitable character for beginner players. Earth's Hero's ultimate, the MUI (Mastered Ultra Instinct) however focuses more on counterattacks with the help of this character's first and third ultimate move, with the Super Blue transformation unlocked through mastery allows for a more offensive approach. Although this character's moveset is decent, they can be punishable if the enemy has their ragdoll cancel ready.
      </h4>
      <h2>Buff Alien</h2>
      <h4>Buff Alien (or, Jiren), is the second released character of Z battlegrounds. Buff Alien provides a moveset that is versatile to many combos and techniques made for the character, making this character also suited for beginner and proffessional players who want to do even more with this character. Buff Alien's ultimate, Absolute Power on the other hand, is a kind of ultimate mode that focuses more on the offensive and aggressive side. This character's moveset is excellent, as it cannot be punishable very easily due to the knockback of most attacks being farther unlike Earths Hero's.
