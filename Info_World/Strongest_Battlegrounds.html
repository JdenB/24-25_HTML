            <h2>The Strongest Hero</h2>
            <h4>The Strongest Hero, previously known as "Bald Hero", is the first character that was added to The Strongest Battlegrounds.  This character is used mostly in close range combat. It has 3 combo extenders that are easy to combo with, unlike most of the other characters, along with having the most unique Ultimate that can only activate one move per ultimate.   This character is based on Saitama, the main character in "One Punch Man" who is a ridiculously powerful being with no limits on strength.   This character is a good starter character for beginners, and the character you always spawn as when you first join the game. As it is relatively easy to combo with.</h4>
            <h2>Hero Hunter</h2>
            <h4>"Hero Hunter" is a playable character in the game, The Strongest Battlegrounds. This character is mainly used for flashy combos and close-range combat. He has no long ranged moves, excluding the massive AOE the ultimate startup creates. It has a moveset consisting of moves that all provide armor when landed, and a passive that allows him to heal once killing an enemy with a finisher. This character is one of the easiest to combo with, making it a good choice for both beginners and more skilled players. When in Ultimate Mode, the player emits a purple aura.  Hero Hunter is one of the two characters that have a counter move in their base form, along with Blade Master.  The “Hero Hunter” moveset is based on Garou., He is an ex-student of the 3rd Ranked S-Class Hero, Bang (also known as Silverfang). He is later known to be the one of the few characters that borrowed the power of god (turned into Cosmic Fear Garou, which is not in the game, but the ultimate has the Cosmic Fear Garou aura.).</h4>
